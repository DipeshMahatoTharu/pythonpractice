# Question 2: Simple Arithmetic with Multiple Variables
# Write a Python program to:

# Declare three variables:
# x with the value 15,
# y with the value 4,
# z with the value 8.
# Perform the following operations:
# Add x and y, and store the result in a new variable sum_xy.
# Multiply z by sum_xy, and store the result in a new variable result.
# Print the values of all variables and the final result.

x,y,z=15,4,8
sum_xy=x+y
result=z*sum_xy

print(x,y,z)
print(sum_xy)
print(result)
