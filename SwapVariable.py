# Question 1: Swapping Variables
# Write a Python program to:

# Declare two variables, a and b, and assign them values 10 and 20, respectively.
# Swap the values of a and b without using a third variable.
# Print the values of a and b before and after swapping.

a ,b =10,20

a,b=b,a

print("before swaping a", a )
print("before swaping ", b)
print("After swaping a :",b)
print("After swaping b :",a)
